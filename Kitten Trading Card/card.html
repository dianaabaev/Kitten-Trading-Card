			<p><em>Kittens are born both deaf and blind. Their eyes are closed as well as their ear canals.</em></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span>Scientific Name</span>: Felis Catus</li>
				<li><span>Habitat</span>: Homes</li>
				<li><span>Average Weight at Birth</span>: 3 pounds</li>
				<li><span>Full Grown Life Span</span>: 13-17 years</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Kittens are born with all different colors and patterns. No matter if they are born from the same litter, they still will have their own distinctive marks. It takes about seven to ten days for their eyes to open fully. And after a few weeks, they quickly develop and start to show their hyperactive side.</p>
